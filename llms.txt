# Matt Bedford — Woodworking

> Handcrafted woodworking and furniture by Matt Bedford, based in Northern Italy.

## About

Matt Bedford is a British woodworker based in Northern Italy, working in both English and Italian. He specialises in handcrafted, bespoke woodworking — from small pieces to large furniture and cabinetry. This is fine woodworking, not carpentry or joinery, and all work is done in the workshop, not on site.

Matt works in the traditional way but incorporates tooling and workflows from the Japanese woodworking tradition. His designs are modern, drawing inspiration from Northern European aesthetics and Japanese joinery.

He works primarily with hardwoods and a variety of wood essences. All timber is either reclaimed or sourced sustainably. Matt is deeply committed to environmental responsibility and workshop safety.

Projects are made from scratch to the client's design and preferences, including timber type and style. Timescales range from a few weeks to several months depending on complexity.

Matt also restores furniture and tools.

## Commissions

Matt is open to commissions. Pricing and timelines are available on request. While woodworking is not his full-time occupation, he does take on commissioned work.
